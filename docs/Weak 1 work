Below are **two perfectly structured Markdown documents**, one for **Week 1** and one for **Week 2**, ready to copy-paste into:

```
/docs/week1_summary.md
/docs/week2_summary.md
```

Both are written as **proper project documentation** — clean, precise, and fully aligned with what you built.

# ✅ **WEEK 1 SUMMARY — `docs/week1_summary.md`**

```md
# Week 1 — Project Setup, API Fetch, Reproducible Pipeline

## 🎯 Objective
Establish a fully reproducible data pipeline with:
- a clean project structure,
- GitHub versioning,
- weather data ingestion via API,
- reproducible execution in both **local PyCharm** and **Google Colab**.

This week defines the *foundation* for all future ETL, EDA, ML and reporting steps.

```

**Why this structure?**
- Separates *source code* from *data outputs*.
- Keeps GitHub clean.
- Supports Colab execution and local execution identically.

# 2. GitHub Setup

### Steps performed:
- Created repo: **mihahafner/data-prototype**
- Cloned locally via PyCharm.
- Configured global git identity.
- Added `.gitignore`:
```

data/raw/
data/processed/
data/*.db

````
- Pushed initial commit with:
- folder structure
- README.md
- requirements.txt
- verify_environment.py

# 3. Notebook: Fetch Weather API → Save CSV
**File:** `notebooks/01_api_to_csv.ipynb`

### Key features:
### ✔ Universal path resolver (works on local + Colab)

```python
REPO_URL = "https://github.com/mihahafner/data-prototype.git"
def get_repo_root():
  in_colab = "google.colab" in sys.modules
  ...
REPO_ROOT = get_repo_root()
RAW = REPO_ROOT / "data" / "raw"
````

### ✔ Weather API call (Open-Meteo)

* Fetch temperature, humidity, timestamps.
* Convert JSON → pandas DataFrame.
* Save “atomic write” CSV:

  ```
  data/raw/weather_lju.csv
  ```

### ✔ Kernel restart issues fixed

* Cleaned state
* Ensured CSV writes outside notebook working directory

---

# 4. Running in Google Colab

### Implemented:

* Auto-clone repo when notebook runs in Colab
* Automatically set paths so CSV files save correctly
* Successfully executed all cells
* Verified reproducibility between:

  * Windows PyCharm
  * Google Colab environment

---

# 5. Final Deliverables (Week 1)

* `notebooks/01_api_to_csv.ipynb`
* `README.md` with project description
* Reproducible pipeline that downloads weather data and writes CSV
* Local + Colab execution fully functional

---

# ✔ Week 1 Completed Successfully

This concludes Week 1: **You now have a fully reproducible, versioned, API-driven data ingestion pipeline.**
